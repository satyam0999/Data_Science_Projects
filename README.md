# Data_Science_Projects

DLithe Consultancy Services Private Limited is Bengaluru based EdTech company, started in the year 2018. It is led by industry professionals with two decades of experience in the field of Information Technology - Product, Project Management, Engineering Excellence and Delivery, Customer Management, Human Resource management areas.

The internship was on Python programming and Data Science. I learned about Python software installation, environment setup followed by programming using basics and advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming. I learnt about importance of data, data extraction, processing and visualisation. I learnt about using various datasets and run the algorithms to discover the data patterns.

Program Summary: •Introduction to Programming •Python installation, Environment Setup •Basics of Python, Syntax, Datatypes, Variables •Loop, Functions •NumPy, Panda's, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc •Working with various datasets •Data extraction, Processing, Visualisation

These are my data science projects:

I have worked with some datasets analyzed them, tried to represent the data using the knowledge I got from my internship.

DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_CAR: In this project, I cleaned the dataset which I had downloaded from the Kaggle website and applied a random forest regression algorithm to train and test the model. A decision tree algorithm is used to determine the accuracy. The predicted and original comparison plotting is done for the selling price.

DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_FISH: In this project, I cleaned the dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle and applied a linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy. Clustering is used to show the data for fishes of different lengths.

DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_GPU: In this project, I cleaned the dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle and applied a linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy, mean squared error is also calculated. Data is represented in different manners.

DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_STOCKS: In this project, I cleaned the dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle and applied a linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy. Data is represented for only some companies. Stocks of only these companies are computed based on some selected features. The result is shown using plotting.

By now, I know Python programming, algorithms and the basics of data science concepts. Overall it was a good experience to enhance my technical skills while I also learned about domain and process. I look forward to implementing these as I begin my career as a software professional, soon.
